# 📖 Project Overview

The **Flask E-Commerce Website** is a full-stack web application designed to simulate a real-world online shopping platform. It enables users to create an account, browse products, manage their shopping cart, and place orders through a clean and responsive interface.

The application follows Flask best practices by separating authentication, database models, forms, payment handling, and administration into individual modules, making the project maintainable and scalable.

This project was developed to strengthen practical knowledge of **Python Full Stack Development**, including backend development, frontend integration, database management, and user authentication.
